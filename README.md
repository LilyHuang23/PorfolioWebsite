# Portfolio Website

To better enhance my web development skill, I create this project to build my portfolio. In this project, I will implement node framework and my web development knowledge.

This is a website project. In the website, you will learn more about me and my other accomplishes. It has two page that you can review my resume and my other social media link. You can also fill out a contact form and leave message to me. One thing I really like is the feature of dark/light mode. I am a big fan of dark mode and I am glad that I can learn that in this project.

The purpose of this website is for every potential employer and client can get to know me better and faster.
